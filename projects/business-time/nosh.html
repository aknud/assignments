                <p class="description">Can one bar be all things to all people? <br> Yes, one can. <br> As an Official Pub Partner of Real Salt Lake, all home and away games are shown on our 8 Flat Screen TVs and giant HD projector screen, along with all English Premier League, Champions League, World Cup and Fox Soccer Channel games. But this isn’t just a soccer bar, Bourbon House also has the NFL Sunday Ticket, and the Pac-12 Network to keep your sports going year round. Not a sports fan? On Tuesday Nights sit back and listen to a local jazz jam featuring numerous inter-changing musicians. Thursday Night is DJ/VJ Birdman.  Local DJ's every Friday and Saturday Night, and come relax on Sunday with $14 - 12oz Slow Cooked Prime Rib. And as always, never a cover charge. <br> This is truly the place.</p>

                <h3>Beer Bar is a love letter to the beer of the world. Our goal is to bring some of that world, and that love, to you all.</h3>
                <p class="description">The perfect pair. <br> Bar X was opened the year Prohibition was repealed in 1933. After our purchase and refurbishing, in 2010, it became the home of craft cocktails and long Utah nights. After 3 years our little baby started begging for a sibling so we gave her Beer Bar. Bar X and Beer Bar now stand as companion pieces. In the mood for a meticulously prepared cocktail with fresh ingredients?  Step through the magic door to Bar X. Did you get hungry and wonder what the score was? Step back through to Beer Bar. Just don’t stand in the doorway, it's not huge.</p>

                <h3>An American Restaurant</h3>
                <p class="description">The Copper Onion is one of the new additions to the growing Utah foodie scene. Former NYC chef (and native Utahan) Ryan Lowder now brings his personal take on New American cuisine to his own kitchen with an approach inspired by his passion for Utah’s outstanding farmstead ingredients and his experience as a chef cooking his way through Barcelona, NYC and South America. The Copper Onion serves a wide array of vegetable side dishes and a menu designed to explore and share, with plates such as Ricotta Dumplings with lemon, sage and brown butter and Braised Pork Belly with seasonal vegetables. An insistent focus on the freshest and best is paramount; sausages and burgers are ground daily, bread is baked and ice cream is made in house, offering casual diners an exceptional experience at affordable prices.</p>
