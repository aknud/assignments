                    As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. You gotta think like a tree. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.

                    Let's build an almighty mountain. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.
                    
                    This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.
